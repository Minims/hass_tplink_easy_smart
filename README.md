The final path to folder should look like this: `<home-assistant-config-folder>/custom_components/tplink_easy_smart`.

### HACS

[Add a custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) `https://github.com/vmakeev/hass_tplink_easy_smart` with `Integration` category to [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

### Advanced options

You can perform advanced component configuration by clicking the `CONFIGURE` button after adding it. Advanced settings include:
* Data update interval
* Enabling or disabling [port state switches](#port-state)

## Sensors

### Network information

The component allows you to get the network information of the switch. 
The sensor value is the IP address of the switch.

There is one sensor that is always present:
* `sensor.<integration_name>_network_info`

The sensor exposes the following attributes:

|     Attribute     |          Description          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `mac`             | The MAC address or the switch |
| `gateway`         | Default gateway               |
| `netmask`         | Subnet mask                   |


## Binary sensors

### Port status

The component allows you to get the status of each port.

There are several sensors that are always present:
* `binary_sensor.<integration_name>_port_<port_number>_state`

Each sensor exposes the following attributes:

|     Attribute        |          Description         |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| `number`             | The number of the port       |
| `speed`              | Actual connection speed*     |
| `speed_config`       | Configured connection speed* |

\* the connection speed is represented by the following values:

|    Value    |        Description        |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `Link Down` | The link is down          |
| `Auto`      | Automatic speed selection |
| `10MH`      | 10 Mbps, half-duplex      |
| `10MF`      | 10 Mbps, full duplex      |
| `100MH`     | 100 Mbps, half-duplex     |
| `100MF`     | 100 Mbps, full duplex     |
| `1000MF`    | 1000 Mbps, full duplex    |

_Note: The sensor will be unavailable if the port is not enabled (see [port state switch](#port-state))._

## Switches

### Port state

The component allows you to enable and disable each port.

By default, adding these switches is disabled, but you can add them via [options](#advanced-options).

There are several switches:
* `switch.<integration_name>_port_<port_number>_enabled`

_Note: don't use this feature if you don't know what you are doing._
